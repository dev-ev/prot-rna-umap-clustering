# prot-rna-umap-clustering
Joint UMAP embedding and clustering of proteomic and transcriptomic data.
Developed by Egor Vorontsov with educational purposes.
The notebook was created in Jupyter Lab on Windows with Python 3.8. The workflow depends on third-party libraries that can be installed with pip:
  pip intsall scipy numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn umap-learn
  
 The data is taken from the [article by Hultqvist *et al*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0568-5). The relative protein abundance table from the proteomic analysis can be found in the repository. The RPKM table from the transcriptomic experiment can be found at the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) project page ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92601).
